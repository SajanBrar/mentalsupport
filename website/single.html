					Of the details reported about the murder of Malcoum Tate, a thirtyfour-year-old man who was killed
					by his younger sister at the side of the road late at night while their mother waited in the car,
					most striking is the fact that his sister shot him thirteen times. On December 18, 1988, Lothell
					Tate, thirty-two, used a .25 caliber weapon that required her to shoot, reload the seven-round
					magazine, and shoot again to hit her brother a full thirteen times in the head and back. Lothell and
					her mother, Pauline Wilkerson, checked for a pulse, and then they rolled Malcoum’s body into a gully
					before driving home to Gastonia, North Carolina.
				</p>
				<p>
					As word of the crime spread, headlines from newspapers such as the Lakeland Ledger, the
					Herald-Journal,
					and the Charlotte Observer provided a framework for Lothell Tate and Pauline Wilkerson’s
					motivations.
					Headlines read, “NC Family’s Final Solution Was Murder,” “Family’s Nightmare Ends with Slaying of
					Problem Child,” and “Death Ends Family’s Nightmare.” The “nightmare” was a life starring their blood
					relation as a persistent threat—a man diagnosed with severe paranoid schizophrenia who had been
					hospitalized again and again and who had been jailed for assault, but who resisted medication and,
					according to anecdote, repeatedly threatened his family like a ghoulish specter. It is reported that
					Malcoum claimed Lothell’s two-year-old daughter had the devil in her, and that God had sent him to
					kill
					her; apparently, Malcoum loomed over their beds at night till either Lothell or Pauline startled
					awake,
					upon which he would laugh a “crazy laugh” and leave the room.
				</p>
				<p>
					National Book Award–winning author Andrew Solomon describes schizophrenia in his 2012 book, Far from
					the Tree: Parents, Children, and the Search for Identity, as “like Alzheimer’s … an illness not of
					accrual but of replacement and deletion; rather than obscuring the previously known person, this
					disease to some degree eliminates that person.” Though there is no direct reference for this
					statement in the book’s extensive notes, his description remains a lyrical summary of how
					schizophrenia is commonly understood. Brainimaging studies of patients with schizophrenia have shown
					a reduced volume of gray matter, as well as ventricular enlargement. In a BBC interview with
					Professor Paul Thompson of UCLA, such examples of tissue damage are described as “[moving] across
					the brain like a forest fire, destroying more tissue as the disease [progresses].”
				</p>
				<p>
					Schizophrenia’s unpleasant prognosis today, as described by researchers like Thompson, is
					essentially the same as it was in the time of Emil Kraepelin and, later, as described by Eugen
					Bleuler. “Dementia praecox” was a progressive and neurodegenerative disease, unlike manic
					depression, or what we now call bipolar disorder. Kraepelin is credited for revealing that manic
					depression, which may also exhibit psychotic symptoms, is a fundamentally different disorder from
					what’s now called schizophrenia, and is also a disorder that does not, unlike schizophrenia, lead to
					a permanently damaged brain.
				</p>
				<p>
					In 2013 I experienced a seven-month-long psychotic episode as a symptom of schizoaffective disorder,
					which I’d been diagnosed with that February. Beginning in 2002, I had tried every atypical
					antipsychotic on the market—atypical antipsychotics being the pharmaceutical family of choice for
					psychosis, proving less likely to cause the severe side effects of their predecessors—and yet none
					of those medications had worked for me. Even Clorazil, considered to be the powerful antipsychotic
					of last resort due its ability to cause a lethal plummet in white blood cell count in some people,
					hadn’t been effective in eliminating my delusions. I was terrified and concerned; my family was
					worried and concerned; my doctor was perplexed and concerned. Dr. M told me that the longer the
					episode lasted, and the more frequently the episodes occurred, the more damage was occurring to my
					brain.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is disconcerting for anyone to be told that her brain is being damaged by an uncontrollable
					illness. It might have been especially disconcerting to me because my brain has been one of my more
					valuable assets since childhood. I began to read at two; I was the first student, boy or girl, to
					finish every available math textbook in my elementary school; I went to Yale and Stanford, and
					graduated from Stanford with a 3.99 GPA, after which I took a job as a lab manager and researcher at
					one of the university’s brain-imaging labs. My anxiety about a loss of gray matter fed a variety of
					delusions: one afternoon I frantically called my husband at work to babble about spiders eating
					holes in my brain. And so I took Solomon’s words like a punch in the gut, but his statement about
					“replacement and deletion” reflects a common narrative about schizophrenia, a narrative unlike those
					about psychiatric diagnoses such as depression or obsessive-compulsive disorder. The story of
					schizophrenia is one with a protagonist, “the schizophrenic,” who is first a fine and good vessel
					with fine and good things inside of it, and then becomes misshapen through the ravages of psychosis;
					the vessel becomes prone to being filled with nasty things. Finally, the wicked thoughts and
					behavior that may ensue become inseparable from the person, who is now unrecognizable from what they
					once were.
				</p>
				<p>
					There isn’t much in the way of public information about Malcoum Tate from before he was diagnosed
					with schizophrenia, in 1977. Young Malcoum received high marks. He was good at, and enjoyed,
					reading; then he went crazy. One day his mother drove with him on Baltimore’s Wilson Street, where
					Malcoum spotted a mailbox with “Wilson” written upon it. The skewed logic of this coincidence
					triggered him to escape from the car, break into the nearest house, and brutally beat the man he
					found inside. This outburst led to his first hospitalization of five.
				</p>
				<p>
					The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) describes itself as “the nation’s largest grassroots
					mental health organization dedicated to building better lives for the millions of Americans affected
					by mental illness.” NAMI is also known in the community of mental health advocates as the first
					place that scared, and often desperate, families go to for support and validation.
				</p>
				<p>
					On its website, a pop-up emerges with the headline “We Call It the NAMI effect.” The NAMI effect is
					described as such:
					<br>Every time you offer your hand to pick someone up.
					<br>Every time you share your strength and ability to persevere.
					<br>Every time you offer support and understanding to a family who is caring for a loved one.
					<br>The NAMI effect grows.
					<br>Hope starts with you.
					<br>It’s unclear from this pop-up who the targeted “you” is supposed to be.
				</p>
				<p>
					NAMI prides itself on its activism: “Each day, NAMI effectively shapes the national public policy
					landscape for people with mental illness and their families.” Such shaping is described in a 2012
					report: listed causes under “Legislation to Improve Mental Health Care in America” include the
					Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act of 2016 (HR 2646) and the Strengthening Mental Health
					in Our Communities Act of 2014 (HR 4574). “NAMI parents,” as the advocacy jargon goes—the parents of
					a child or children with mental health issues who are involved in NAMI-sanctioned activism —showed
					up and spoke out at 2014 committee meetings regarding California’s Assembly Bill No. 1421 (AB 1421).
				</p>
				<p>
					Public comment at such meetings occurred in counties across California as each deliberated over
					whether to adopt AB 1421, created in 2002 to open the door for the benign-sounding “assisted
					outpatient treatment,” also known as the “involuntary treatment of any person with a mental disorder
					who, as a result of the mental disorder, is a danger to others or to himself or herself, or is
					gravely disabled.” AB 1421 “would [also] create an assisted outpatient treatment program for any
					person who is suffering from a mental disorder and meets certain criteria.” Like the idea of the
					Strengthening Mental Health in Our Communities Act, AB 1421 appears, in many ways, unassailable: who
					wouldn’t want to give help to people who need it?
				</p>
				<p>
					And yet the debate over AB 1421, as I discovered in San Francisco, touched upon crucial issues of
					autonomy and civil liberties. The bill makes the assumption that people who display a certain level
					of mental disorder are no longer capable of choosing their own treatment, including medication, and
					therefore must be forced into doing so. Sartre claimed, “We are our choices,” but what has a person
					become when it’s assumed that said person is innately incapable of choice?
				</p>
				<p><br>
					The Exorcist was released in 1973, four years before Malcoum Tate was first hospitalized. Named the
					scariest film of all time by Entertainment Weekly, The Exorcist is described by Warner Bros. as a
					movie about “an innocent girl … inhabited by a terrifying entity, her mother’s frantic resolve to
					save her … and two priests … who come together in a battle of ultimate evil.”
				</p>
				<p>
					The “innocent girl” is Regan (Linda Blair), who becomes possessed by the “terrifying entity” after
					using a Ouija board; her mother is Chris (Ellen Burstyn), a busy actress who receives invitations to
					the White House and purposefully bustles across crowded film sets. We first meet Regan as she bounds
					on-screen, all blunt bangs and big eyes, to give her mother a kiss hello. How was her day? Well, she
					played a game in the backyard, there was a picnic, and she also saw a “beautiful gray horse.” She
					emphasizes her role as a sweetly privileged, all-American girleen as she wheedles, “Oh, Mom, can’t
					we get a horse?” Even her use of the doomed Ouija board smacks of whimsy: when she first uses it
					onscreen, with Chris by her side, she demonstrates the spirit’s presence by asking, “Do you think my
					mom’s pretty?”
				</p>
				<p>
					Once possessed, Regan vanishes. She hits her doctor—her face seems plastic; her voice is an
					unrecognizable growl. “Keep away!” she screams. “The sow is mine! Fuck me!” Chris, frustrated by Dr.
					Klein’s explanations of her daughter’s behavior, demands, “What are you talking about, for Christ’s
					sake? Did you see her or not? She’s acting like a fucking out-of-her-mind psychotic or a split
					personality.”
				</p>
				<p>
					As is Chris’s story in The Exorcist, Pauline and Lothell’s narrative is one about being both
					terrified and consistently let down. Regan’s doctor, a figure of authority and a source of hope, is
					useless. Malcoum Tate was repeatedly released from jails and hospitals once he was determined by
					authorities to be “better,” or “not a threat to himself or others.” After a yearlong 1984
					hospitalization in Baltimore, Malcoum improved, but his condition regressed approximately two years
					later after he stopped taking his medication. According to Lothell, Malcoum kicked down an apartment
					door one morning in the fall of 1988, causing the family to be evicted. In both stories of
					possession we have a sense of familial desperation, of not knowing what to do.
				</p>
				<p><br>
					In searching for local NAMI members who advocated for AB 1421, I was put in touch with a woman whom
					I’ll call Beth. A chatty, impassioned woman who asked to remain anonymous, Beth has been a NAMI
					member since the mid-’90s. Ask her to talk about mental health public policy, and she does so in the
					manner of someone who is both well informed and highly opinionated; her many thoughts about jails
					and 5150s (code for involuntary hospitalization) and the dramatic story of her own mentally ill
					family member come out in a rush of memorized statistics and mental health policies.
				</p>
				<p>
					Beth’s family member, an adult male, lives with schizoaffective disorder. In relating the
					development of his illness, she says of him, “He was an excellent student, and the following year,
					he started having these rage attacks.” She tried to get him treatment. The mental health system, a
					mess of private facilities, hospitals, and HMO-limited therapy sessions, has hospitalized him over
					seventy times, says Beth, which has repeatedly put her into dire financial straits. She continues to
					fight for the laws that she believes would help him, including AB 1421: “If you have a history [like
					he does] … of when he’s off medicine, of getting so manic, and so violent that nine times in one
					year he’s called the police himself, saying, ‘Please take me to the hospital, I want to kill
					[Beth],’ then that person should be on medication, not after he kills me or himself.” I nod when I
					talk to Beth. I say “Yeah” a lot. I find myself thinking, How can anyone possibly argue a case
					against this woman, who has found herself in terrible circumstances as she tries to help someone she
					loves?
				</p>
				<p>
					Lothell Tate explained on the stand, “I was just saying to myself this is the only thing I know to
					do, that we done asked people to help us and we done begged people to help us and nobody did
					anything, and I was scared that one day Malcoum was going to lose his mind and harm me and my
					daughter.”
				</p>
				<p>
					It is impossible for me not to feel sympathetic toward Beth; it’s even impossible for me to feel
					completely antagonistic toward Lothell and Pauline, both of whom were found guilty at their trial
					after only one hour of jury deliberation. I hear the bewilderment in Beth’s voice when she talks
					about how there are no options for long term care—when I ask, “In San Francisco or everywhere?,” she
					replies, “All over the nation. Unless you have enough money.” To say that the options for family
					members with severely mentally ill, psychotic relatives are limited is a comical understatement.
					People like Beth go to NAMI because they feel that there’s nowhere else to turn.
