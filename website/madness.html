                <p>
                    Madness in civilization? Surely madness is the very negation of civilization? Enlightenment
                    thinkers, after all, used to argue that Reason is the faculty that distinguishes human beings from
                    beasts. If that is so, then surely Unreason is what lies beyond the pale, corresponding in some
                    sense to the point at which the civilized becomes the savage. Madness is not in civilization, but
                    something wholly outside it and alien to it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On reflection, however, matters are not quite so simple. Paradoxically, madness exists not just in
                    opposition to civilization, or solely on its margins. On the contrary, it has been a central topic
                    of concern for artists, for dramatists, novelists, composers, divines, and physicians and
                    scientists, not to mention how closely it affects almost all of us – either through our own
                    encounters with disturbances of reason and emotion, or through those of family members and friends.
                    In important ways, that is, madness is indelibly part of civilization, not located outside it. It is
                    a problem that insistently invades our consciousness and our daily lives. It is thus at once liminal
                    and anything but.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Madness is a disturbing subject, one whose mysteries puzzle us still. The loss of reason, the sense
                    of alienation from the common-sense world the rest of us imagine we inhabit, 1 the shattering
                    emotional turmoil that seizes hold of some of us and will not let go: these are a part of our shared
                    human experience down through the centuries and in every culture. Insanity haunts the human
                    imagination. It fascinates and frightens all at once. Few are immune to its terrors. It reminds
                    insistently of how tenuous our own hold on reality may sometimes be. It challenges our sense of the
                    very limits of what it is to be human.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My subject is madness in civilization. Their relationship, and their complex and multi-vocal
                    interactions are what I mean to explore and make sense of here. Why madness? That is a term that has
                    overtones of anachronism, even of a callous disregard for the sufferings of those we have learned to
                    call the mentally ill, an ill-mannered, or worse, resort to a vocabulary at once stigmatizing and
                    offensive. Heaping more miseries on the mad, adding to the stigma that has enveloped them through
                    the ages, could not be further from my intent. The pain and misery that losing one’s mind entails
                    for its victims, for their loved ones and for society at large is something no one who encounters
                    this subject can or should ignore, nor minimize. Here lie some of the most profound forms of human
                    suffering – sadness, isolation, alienation, misery and the death of reason and of consciousness. So
                    once more, and more insistently this time, why do I not opt for some softer term – mental illness or
                    mental disturbance, let us say – rather than deliberately employ what we have come to view as the
                    harsher word, madness?
                </p>
                <p>
                    For psychiatrists, our designated authority these days on the mysteries of mental pathologies, the
                    use of such terms is often seen as a provocation, a rejection of science and its blessings, which
                    they claim to exemplify. (Oddly enough, precisely for that reason, madness is a word defiantly
                    embraced by those who vociferously reject psychiatry’s claims and resist the label of psychiatric
                    patient, preferring to refer to themselves as psychiatric survivors.) So is my choice of title and
                    terminology perverse, or a sign that, like some influential writers – the late Thomas Szasz, for
                    example – I consider mental illness a myth? Not at all.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my view, madness – massive and lasting disturbances of reason, intellect and emotions – is a
                    phenomenon to be found in all known societies, one that poses profound challenges of both a
                    practical and symbolic sort to the social fabric, and to the very notion of a stable social order.
                    The claim that it is all a matter of social constructions or labels is to my mind so much romantic
                    nonsense, or a useless tautology. Those who lose control of their emotions, whether melancholic or
                    manic; those who do not share the common-sense reality most of us perceive and the mental universe
                    we inhabit, who hallucinate or make claims about their existence that people around them conclude
                    are delusions; those who act in ways that are profoundly at variance with the conventions and
                    expectations of their culture, and are heedless of the ordinary corrective measures their community
                    mobilizes to induce them to desist; those who manifest extremes of extravagance and incoherence, or
                    who exhibit the grotesquely denuded mental life of the demented: these form the core of those we
                    look upon as irrational, and are the population that for millennia was regarded as mad, or referred
                    to by some analogous term.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Why am I writing a history of ‘madness’ or ‘mental illness’? Why not call it a history of
                    psychiatry? To such questions I have a simple answer. That kind of ‘history’ wouldn’t be a history
                    at all. I plan to discuss the encounter between madness and civilization over more than two
                    millennia. For the great majority of that time, madness and its cognates – insanity, lunacy, frenzy,
                    mania, melancholia, hysteria and the like – were the terms in general usage, not just among the
                    masses or even the educated classes, but universally. Indisputably, ‘madness’ was not only the
                    everyday term employed to come to terms with Unreason, but a terminology embraced by those medical
                    men who sought to account for its depredations in naturalistic terms, and at times to treat the
                    alienated. Even the first mad-doctors (for such they called themselves, and were known as by their
                    contemporaries) did not hesitate to use the word, and it persisted in polite discourse, alongside
                    other terms including lunacy and insanity, almost all the way through the nineteenth century, only
                    gradually becoming linguistically taboo.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As for ‘psychiatry’, it is a word that did not begin to emerge until the nineteenth century in
                    Germany. It was fiercely rejected by the French (who preferred their own term aliénisme), and by the
                    English-speaking world, which began, as I alluded to in the previous paragraph, by calling medical
                    men who specialized in the management of the mad ‘mad-doctors’. Only later, when the ambiguities and
                    implied contempt – the slur embodied in that term – came to seem too much, did the proto-profession
                    embrace without a clear preference a whole array of alternatives: ‘asylum superintendent’, ‘medical
                    psychologist’ or (in a nod to the French) ‘alienist’. The one label English-speaking specialists in
                    mental disorders could not abide, and fought against using into the early years of the twentieth
                    century (when it finally began to be the preferred term), was ‘psychiatrist’.
                </p>
                <p>
                    More broadly, the emergence of a self-conscious and organized group of professionals who laid claim
                    to jurisdiction over mental disturbance, and who obtained a measure of social warrant for their
                    claims, is largely a phenomenon of the period from the nineteenth century onwards. Madness is now
                    mostly viewed through a medical lens, and the language preferred by psychiatrists has become the
                    officially approved medium through which most (though not all) speak of these matters. But this is
                    the result of historical change, and in a wider view, quite a recent development. The creation of
                    such professionals, their language and their chosen interventions, are phenomena that we shall
                    discuss and try to comprehend. But they are not, and ought not to be, our starting place.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So madness it is, a term that even now few people have difficulty in understanding. Using that
                    age-old word has the further advantage that it throws into relief another highly significant feature
                    of our subject that a purely medical focus neglects. Madness has much broader salience for the
                    social order and the cultures we form part of, and has resonance in the world of literature and art
                    and of religious belief, as well as in the scientific domain. And it implies stigma, and stigma has
                    been and continues to be a lamentable aspect of what it means to be mad.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even in our own time, definitive answers about the condition remain almost as elusive as ever. The
                    very boundaries that separate the mad from the sane are a matter of dispute. The American
                    Psychiatric Association, whose Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) has achieved global
                    influence, not least because of its linkages to the psychopharmacological revolution, has subjected
                    its bible to seemingly endless iteration and revision. Yet despite these various efforts to achieve
                    resolution, the DSM remains enmeshed in controversy, even at the highest reaches of the profession
                    itself. Depending upon how one counts, it is now on its fifth or its seventh revision, and the
                    publication of its latest incarnation has been delayed by years of wrangling and public controversy
                    over its contents. As its lists of diagnoses and ‘diseases’ proliferate, the frantic efforts to
                    distinguish ever-larger numbers of types and sub-types of mental disorder come to seem like an
                    elaborately disguised game of make-believe. After all, despite the plethora of claims that mental
                    illness is rooted in faulty brain biochemistry, deficiencies or surpluses of this or that
                    neurotransmitter, the product of genetics and one day perhaps traceable to biological markers, the
                    aetiology of most mental illness remains obscure, and its treatments are largely symptomatic and
                    generally of dubious efficacy. Those who suffer from serious psychoses make up one of the few
                    segments of our societies whose life expectancy has declined over the past quarter of a century2 –
                    one telling measure of the gap between psychiatry’s pretensions and its performance. In this arena,
                    at least, we have not yet learned how to cut nature at the joints.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The wager that handing madness over to the ministrations of medics will have a practical payoff has
                    had some successes – most notably with respect to tertiary syphilis, a terrible disorder that
                    accounted for perhaps 20 per cent of male admissions to asylums in the early twentieth century. For
                    the most part, however, it is a bet we have yet to collect on. Notwithstanding periodic breathless
                    proclamations to the contrary, the roots of schizophrenia or of major depression remain wrapped in
                    mystery and confusion. And with no X-rays, no MRIs, no PET scans, no laboratory tests that allow us
                    to proclaim unambiguously that this person is mad, that person sane, the boundaries between Reason
                    and Unreason remain shifting and uncertain, contested and controversial.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We run enormous risks of misconstruing history when we project contemporary diagnostic categories
                    and psychiatric understandings back on to the past. We cannot safely engage in retrospective
                    diagnosis even in the case of diseases whose contemporary reality and identities seem far more
                    securely established than schizophrenia or bipolar disorder – not to mention a host of other, more
                    controversial psychiatric diagnoses. Observers in earlier times recorded what they saw as relevant,
                    not what we might like to know. Besides, the manifestations of madness, its meanings, its
                    consequences, where one draws the boundary between sanity and insanity – then and now – these are
                    matters that are deeply affected by the social context within which Unreason surfaces and is
                    contained. Context matters, and we cannot attain an Archimedean view from nowhere, beyond the
                    partialities of the present, from which we might survey in a neutral and unbiased fashion the
                    complexities of history
                </p>
                <p>
                    Madness extends beyond the medical grasp in other ways. It remains a source of recurrent fascination
                    for writers and artists, and for their audiences. Novels, biographies, autobiographies, plays,
                    films, paintings, sculpture – in all these realms and more, Unreason continues to haunt the
                    imagination and to surface in powerful and unpredictable ways. All attempts to corral and contain
                    it, to reduce it to some single essence seem doomed to disappointment. Madness continues to tease
                    and to puzzle us, to frighten and to fascinate, to challenge us to probe its ambiguities and its
                    depredations. Mine will be an account that seeks to give psychological medicine its due, but no more
                    than its due; one that stresses how far we remain from any adequate understanding of the roots of
                    madness, let alone from effective responses to the miseries it entails; and one that recognizes that
                    madness has a social and cultural salience and importance that dwarf any single set of meanings and
                    practices.
