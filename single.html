								<p>Toward a Pathology of the Possessed</p>
<p>Of the details reported about the murder of Malcoum Tate, a thirty-four-year-old man who was killed by his younger sister at the side of the road late at night while their mother waited in the car, most striking is the fact that his sister shot him thirteen times. On December 18, 1988, Lothell Tate, thirty-two, used a .25 caliber weapon that required her to shoot, reload the seven-round magazine, and shoot again to hit her brother a full thirteen times in the head and back. Lothell and her mother, Pauline Wilkerson, checked for a pulse, and then they rolled Malcoum’s body into a gully before driving home to Gastonia, North Carolina.</p>
<p>As word of the crime spread, headlines from newspapers such as the Lakeland Ledger, the Herald-Journal, and the Charlotte Observer provided a framework for Lothell Tate and Pauline Wilkerson’s motivations. Headlines read, “NC Family’s Final Solution Was Murder,” “Family’s Nightmare Ends with Slaying of Problem Child,” and “Death Ends Family’s Nightmare.” The “nightmare” was a life starring their blood relation as a persistent threat—a man diagnosed with severe paranoid schizophrenia who had been hospitalized again and again and who had been jailed for assault, but who resisted medication and, according to anecdote, repeatedly threatened his family like a ghoulish specter. It is reported that Malcoum claimed Lothell’s two-year-old daughter had the devil in her, and that God had sent him to kill her; apparently, Malcoum loomed over their beds at night till either Lothell or Pauline startled awake, upon which he would laugh a “crazy laugh” and leave the room.</p>
<p>National Book Award–winning author Andrew Solomon describes schizophrenia in his 2012 book, Far from the Tree: Parents, Children, and the Search for Identity, as “like Alzheimer’s … an illness not of accrual but of replacement and deletion; rather than obscuring the previously known person, this disease to some degree eliminates that person.” Though there is no direct reference for this statement in the book’s extensive notes, his description remains a lyrical summary of how schizophrenia is commonly understood. Brain-imaging studies of patients with schizophrenia have shown a reduced volume of gray matter, as well as ventricular enlargement. In a BBC interview with Professor Paul Thompson of UCLA, such examples of tissue damage are described as “[moving] across the brain like a forest fire, destroying more tissue as the disease [progresses].”</p>
<p>Schizophrenia’s unpleasant prognosis today, as described by researchers like Thompson, is essentially the same as it was in the time of Emil Kraepelin and, later, as described by Eugen Bleuler. “Dementia praecox” was a progressive and neurodegenerative disease, unlike manic depression, or what we now call bipolar disorder. Kraepelin is credited for revealing that manic depression, which may also exhibit psychotic symptoms, is a fundamentally different disorder from what’s now called schizophrenia, and is also a disorder that does not, unlike schizophrenia, lead to a permanently damaged brain.</p>
<p>In 2013 I experienced a seven-month-long psychotic episode as a symptom of schizoaffective disorder, which I’d been diagnosed with that February. Beginning in 2002, I had tried every atypical antipsychotic on the market—atypical antipsychotics being the pharmaceutical family of choice for psychosis, proving less likely to cause the severe side effects of their predecessors—and yet none of those medications had worked for me. Even Clorazil, considered to be the powerful antipsychotic of last resort due its ability to cause a lethal plummet in white blood cell count in some people, hadn’t been effective in eliminating my delusions. I was terrified and concerned; my family was worried and concerned; my doctor was perplexed and concerned. Dr. M told me that the longer the episode lasted, and the more frequently the episodes occurred, the more damage was occurring to my brain.</p>
<p>It is disconcerting for anyone to be told that her brain is being damaged by an uncontrollable illness. It might have been especially disconcerting to me because my brain has been one of my more valuable assets since childhood. I began to read at two; I was the first student, boy or girl, to finish every available math textbook in my elementary school; I went to Yale and Stanford, and graduated from Stanford with a 3.99 GPA, after which I took a job as a lab manager and researcher at one of the university’s brain-imaging labs. My anxiety about a loss of gray matter fed a variety of delusions: one afternoon I frantically called my husband at work to babble about spiders eating holes in my brain. And so I took Solomon’s words like a punch in the gut, but his statement about “replacement and deletion” reflects a common narrative about schizophrenia, a narrative unlike those about psychiatric diagnoses such as depression or obsessive-compulsive disorder. The story of schizophrenia is one with a protagonist, “the schizophrenic,” who is first a fine and good vessel with fine and good thoughts, and then a wrecked and wasted vessel with wicked thoughts. The plot of schizophrenia is a long, downward path into hell.</p>
<p>People with psychotic disorders have the right to refuse treatment. Involuntary hospitalization and forced medication require a court order and are limited to situations in which a person is a danger to themselves or others or is so gravely disabled by their illness that they cannot provide for their own basic needs. In New York State, “grave disability” means being unable to consistently provide oneself with food, clothing, or shelter. It is often said by psychiatrists and mental health advocates that those who most need psychiatric treatment are those least likely to accept it. Schizophrenia is not just an illness of the brain but also an illness of the mind; often, to those in the grips of psychosis, their delusions and hallucinations are very real. The diagnostic criterion for the disorder includes a lack of insight into one’s own illness, so a person with schizophrenia may not believe they are ill and may refuse treatment as a result.</p>
<p>It seems that most of the time, it is the families and friends of those who are psychotic who must make the hard decisions about treatment for their loved one. In this difficult position, families may turn to extreme measures such as involuntary commitment or “tough love” tactics of cutting off contact or financial support in the hope that the person will “hit bottom” and accept treatment. It is important for families to know that there are resources and services available to help them navigate the challenges of caring for a loved one with a psychotic disorder. NAMI, the National Alliance on Mental Illness, offers support groups, educational programs, and advocacy for individuals and families affected by mental illness.</p>
<p>I do not believe that my family should have been legally allowed to force me into treatment. If they had been able to do so, I would have experienced profound trauma. I have experienced profound trauma in response to involuntary hospitalization in the past. As a woman with a diagnosis of a psychotic disorder who has had her rights violated while in psychiatric care, I have mixed feelings about the laws that govern involuntary treatment. However, as a mother, I understand the desperation and powerlessness one might feel when a loved one is in the throes of psychosis and refuses treatment.</p>
<p>When a person with schizophrenia does accept treatment, the journey is far from over. Even with the most effective antipsychotic medications, many individuals with schizophrenia continue to experience symptoms. In my case, I was finally prescribed a medication that worked after seven months of psychosis. Though the medication quelled the hallucinations and delusions, it also rendered me bedridden and unable to speak. With time and the help of a good psychiatrist and psychologist, I was able to wean myself off that medication and find a balance that allowed me to return to work, care for my children, and enjoy my life once again.</p>
<p>Psychosis, like cancer, is a potentially life-threatening illness. Also like cancer, psychosis can leave a person with a diminished quality of life even after successful treatment. For some people, schizophrenia is a lifelong illness; for others, it is an episodic one, like it is for me. I do not know what my future holds in terms of my mental health, but I am optimistic that continued research and new treatment options will offer hope for a better quality of life for those affected by schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.</p>
