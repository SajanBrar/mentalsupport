                <p><b>The Nature of the Human Mind, and How It Is Better Known Than the Body</b></p>
                <p>
                    So serious are the doubts into which I have been thrown as a result of yesterday’s meditation that I
                    can neither put them out of my mind nor see any way of resolving them. It feels as if I have fallen
                    unexpectedly into a deep whirlpool which tumbles me around so that I can neither stand on the bottom
                    nor swim up to the top. Nevertheless I will make an effort and once more attempt the same path which
                    I started on yesterday. Anything which admits of the slightest doubt I will set aside just as if I
                    had found it to be wholly false; and I will proceed in this way until I recognize something certain,
                    or, if nothing else, until I at least recognize for certain that there is no certainty. Archimedes
                    used to demand just one firm and immovable point in order to shift the entire earth; so I too can
                    hope for great things if I manage to find just one thing, however slight, that is certain and
                    unshakeable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I will suppose then, that everything I see is spurious. I will believe that my memory tells me lies,
                    and that none of the things that it reports ever happened. I have no senses. Body, shape, extension,
                    movement, and place are chimeras. So what remains true? Perhaps just the one fact that nothing is
                    certain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yet apart from everything I have just listed, how do I know that there is not something else which
                    does not allow even the slightest occasion for doubt? Is there not a God, or whatever I may call
                    him, who puts into me the thoughts I am now having? But why do I think this, since I myself may
                    perhaps be the author of these thoughts? In that case am not I, at least, something? But I have just
                    said that I have no senses and no body. This is the sticking point: what follows from this? Am I not
                    so bound up with a body and with senses that I cannot exist without them? But I have convinced
                    myself that there is absolutely nothing in the world, no sky, no earth, no minds, no bodies. Does it
                    now follow that I too do not exist? No: if I convinced myself of something, then I certainly
                    existed. But there is a deceiver of supreme power and cunning who is deliberately and constantly
                    deceiving me. In that case I too undoubtedly exist, if he is deceiving me; and let him deceive me as
                    much as he can, he will never bring it about that I am nothing so long as I think that I am
                    something. So after considering everything very thoroughly, I must finally conclude that this
                    proposition, I am, I exist, is necessarily true whenever it is put forward by me or conceived in my
                    mind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But I do not yet have a sufficient understanding of what this “I” is, that now necessarily exists.
                    So I must be on my guard against carelessly taking something else to be this “I,” and so making a
                    mistake in the very item of knowledge that I maintain is the most certain and evident of all. I will
                    therefore go back and meditate on what I originally believed myself to be, before I embarked on this
                    present train of thought. I will then subtract anything capable of being weakened, even minimally,
                    by the arguments now introduced, so that what is left at the end may be exactly and only what is
                    certain and unshakeable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What then did I formerly think I was? A man. But what is a man? Shall I say “a rational animal’’?
                    No; for then I should have to inquire what an animal is, what rationality is, and in this way one
                    question would lead me down the slope to other harder ones, and I do not now have the time to waste
                    on subtleties of this kind. Instead I propose to concentrate on what came into my thoughts
                    spontaneously and quite naturally whenever I used to consider what I was. Well, the first thought to
                    come to mind was that I had a face, hands, arms, and the whole mechanical structure of limbs which
                    can be seen in a corpse, and which I called the body. The next thought was that I was nourished,
                    that I moved about, and that I engaged in sense-perception and thinking; and these actions I
                    attributed to the soul. But as to the nature of this soul, either I did not think about this or else
                    I imagined it to be something tenuous, like a wind or fire or ether, which permeated my more solid
                    parts. As to the body, however, I had no doubts about it, but thought I knew its nature distinctly.
                    If I had tried to describe the mental conception I had of it, I would have expressed it as follows:
                    by a body I understand whatever has a determinable shape and a definable location and can occupy a
                    space in such a way as to exclude any other body; it can be perceived by touch, sight, hearing,
                    taste, or smell, and can be moved in various ways, not by itself but by whatever else comes into
                    contact with it. For, according to my judgement, the power of self-movement, like the power of
                    sensation or of thought, was quite foreign to the nature of a body; indeed, it was a source of
                    wonder to me that certain bodies were found to contain faculties of this kind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But what shall I now say that I am, when I am supposing that there is some supremely powerful and,
                    if it is permissible to say so, malicious deceiver, who is deliberately trying to trick me in every
                    way he can? Can I now assert that I possess even the most insignificant of all the attributes which
                    I have just said belong to the nature of a body? I scrutinize them, think about them, go over them
                    again, but nothing suggests itself; it is tiresome and pointless to go through the list once more.
                    But what about the attributes I assigned to the soul? Nutrition or movement? Since now I do not have
                    a body, these are mere fabrications. Sense-perception? This surely does not occur without a body,
                    and besides, when asleep I have appeared to perceive through the senses many things which I
                    afterwards realized I did not perceive through the senses at all. Thinking? At last I have
                    discovered it—thought; this alone is inseparable from me. I am, I exist—that is certain. But for how
                    long? For as long as I am thinking. For it could be that were I totally to cease from thinking, I
                    should totally cease to exist. At present I am not admitting anything except what is necessarily
                    true. I am, then, in the strict sense only a thing that thinks; that is, I am a mind, or
                    intelligence, or intellect, or reason—words whose meaning I have been ignorant of until now. But for
                    all that I am a thing which is real and which truly exists. But what kind of a thing? As I have just
                    said—a thinking thing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What else am I? I will use my imagination. I am not that structure of limbs which is called a human
                    body. I am not even some thin vapour which permeates the limbs— a wind, fire, air, breath, or
                    whatever I depict in my imagination; for these are things which I have supposed to be nothing. Let
                    this supposition stand; for all that I am still something. And yet may it not perhaps be the case
                    that these very things which I am supposing to be nothing, because they are unknown to me, are in
                    reality identical with the “I” of which I am aware? I do not know, and for the moment I shall not
                    argue the point, since I can make judgements only about things which are known to me. I know that I
                    exist; the question is, what is this “I” that I know? If the “I” is understood strictly as we have
                    been taking it, then it is quite certain that knowledge of it does not depend on things of whose
                    existence I am as yet unaware; so it cannot depend on any of the things which I invent in my
                    imagination. And this very word “invent” shows me my mistake. It would indeed be a case of
                    fictitious invention if I used my imagination to establish that I was something or other; for
                    imagining is simply contemplating the shape or image of a corporeal thing. Yet now I know for
                    certain both that I exist and at the same time that all such images and, in general, everything
                    relating to the nature of body, could be mere dreams (and chimeras). Once this point has been
                    grasped, to say “I will use my imagination to get to know more distinctly what I am” would seem to
                    be as silly as saying “I am now awake, and see some truth; but since my vision is not yet clear
                    enough, I will deliberately fall asleep so that my dreams may provide a truer and clearer
                    representation.” I thus realize that none of the things that the imagination enables me to grasp is
                    at all relevant to this knowledge of myself which I possess, and that the mind must therefore be
                    most carefully diverted from such things if it is to perceive its own nature as distinctly as
                    possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But what then am I? A thing that thinks. What is that? A thing that doubts, understands, affirms,
                    denies, is willing, is unwilling, and also imagines and has sensory perceptions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is a considerable list, if everything on it belongs to me. But does it? Is it not one and the
                    same “I” who is now doubting almost everything, who nonetheless understands some things, who affirms
                    that this one thing is true, denies everything else, desires to know more, is unwilling to be
                    deceived, imagines many things even involuntarily, and is aware of many things which apparently come
                    from the senses? Are not all these things just as true as the fact that I exist, even if I am asleep
                    all the time, and even if he who created me is doing all he can to deceive me? Which of all these
                    activities is distinct from my thinking? Which of them can be said to be separate from myself? The
                    fact that it is I who am doubting and understanding and willing is so evident that I see no way of
                    making it any clearer. But it is also the case that the “I” who imagines is the same “I.” For even
                    if, as I have supposed, none of the objects of imagination are real, the power of imagination is
                    something which really exists and is part of my thinking. Lastly, it is also the same “I” who has
                    sensory perceptions, or is aware of bodily things as it were through the senses. For example, I am
                    now seeing light, hearing a noise, feeling heat. But I am asleep, so all this is false. Yet I
                    certainly seem to see, to hear, and to be warmed. This cannot be false; what is called “having a
                    sensory perception” is strictly just this, and in this restricted sense of the term it is simply
                    thinking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From all this I am beginning to have a rather better understanding of what I am. But it still
                    appears—and I cannot stop thinking this—that the corporeal things of which images are formed in my
                    thought, and which the senses investigate, are known with much more distinctness than this puzzling
                    “I” which cannot be pictured in the imagination. And yet it is surely surprising that I should have
                    a more distinct grasp of things which I realize are doubtful, unknown, and foreign to me, than I
                    have of that which is true and known—my own self. But I see what it is: my mind enjoys wandering off
                    and will not yet submit to being restrained within the bounds of truth. Very well then; just this
                    once let us give it a completely free rein, so that after a while, when it is time to tighten the
                    reins, it may more readily submit to being curbed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let us consider the things which people commonly think they understand most distinctly of all; that
                    is, the bodies which we touch and see. I do not mean bodies in general—for general perceptions are
                    apt to be somewhat more confused—but one particular body. Let us take, for example, this piece of
                    wax. It has just been taken from the honeycomb; it has not yet quite lost the taste of the honey; it
                    retains some of the scent of the flowers from which it was gathered; its colour, shape, and size are
                    plain to see; it is hard, cold and can be handled without difficulty; if you rap it with your
                    knuckle, it makes a sound. In short, it has everything which appears necessary to enable a body to
                    be known as distinctly as possible. But even as I speak, I put the wax by the fire and look: the
                    residual taste is eliminated, the smell goes away, the colour changes, the shape is lost, the size
                    increases; it becomes liquid and hot; you can hardly touch it, and if you strike it, it no longer
                    makes a sound. But does the same wax remain? It must be admitted that it does; no one denies it, no
                    one thinks otherwise. So what was it in the wax that I understood with such distinctness? Evidently
                    none of the features which I arrived at by means of the senses; for whatever came under taste,
                    smell, sight, touch, or hearing has now altered—yet the wax remains.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Perhaps the answer lies in the thought which now comes to my mind; namely, the wax was not after all
                    the sweetness of the honey, or the fragrance of the flowers, or the whiteness, or the shape, or the
                    sound, but was rather a body which presented itself to me in these various forms a little while ago,
                    but which now exhibits different ones. But what exactly is it that I am now imagining? Let us
                    concentrate, take away everything which does not belong to the wax, and see what is left: merely
                    something extended, flexible, and changeable. But what is meant here by “flexible” and “changeable”?
                    Is it what I picture in my imagination: that this piece of wax is capable of changing from a round
                    shape to a square shape, or from a square shape to a triangular shape? Not at all; for I can grasp
                    that the wax is capable of countless changes of this kind, yet I am unable to run through this
                    immeasurable number of changes in my imagination, from which it follows that it is not the faculty
                    of imagination that gives me my grasp of the wax as flexible and changeable. And what is meant by
                    “extended”? Is the extension of the wax also unknown? For it increases if the wax melts, increases
                    again if it boils, and is greater still if the heat is increased. I would not be making a correct
                    judgement about the nature of wax unless I believed it capable of being extended in many more
                    different ways than I will ever encompass in my imagination. I must therefore admit that the nature
                    of this piece of wax is in no way revealed by my imagination, but is perceived by the mind alone. (I
                    am speaking of this particular piece of wax; the point is even clearer with regard to wax in
                    general.) But what is this wax which is perceived by the mind alone? It is of course the same wax
                    which I see, which I touch, which I picture in my imagination, in short the same wax which I thought
                    it to be from the start. And yet, and here is the point, the perception I have of it is a case not
                    of vision or touch or imagination—nor has it ever been, despite previous appearances—but of purely
                    mental scrutiny; and this can be imperfect and confused, as it was before, or clear and distinct as
                    it is now, depending on how carefully I concentrate on what the wax consists in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But as I reach this conclusion I am amazed at how (weak and) prone to error my mind is. For although
                    I am thinking about these matters within myself, silently and without speaking, nonetheless the
                    actual words bring me up short, and I am almost tricked by ordinary ways of talking. We say that we
                    see the wax itself, if it is there before us, not that we judge it to be there from its colour or
                    shape; and this might lead me to conclude without more ado that knowledge of the wax comes from what
                    the eye sees, and not from the scrutiny of the mind alone. But then if I look out of the window and
                    see men crossing the square, as I just happen to have done, I normally say that I see the men
                    themselves, just as I say that I see the wax. Yet do I see any more than hats and coats which could
                    conceal automatons? I judge that they are men. And so something which I thought I was seeing with my
                    eyes is in fact grasped solely by the faculty of judgement which is in my mind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, one who wants to achieve knowledge above the ordinary level should feel ashamed at having
                    taken ordinary ways of talking as a basis for doubt. So let us proceed, and consider on which
                    occasion my perception of the nature of the wax was more perfect and evident. Was it when I first
                    looked at it, and believed I knew it by my external senses, or at least by what they call the
                    “common” sense— that is, the power of imagination? Or is my knowledge more perfect now, after a more
                    careful investigation of the nature of the wax and of the means by which it is known? Any doubt on
                    this issue would clearly be foolish; for what distinctness was there in my earlier perception? Was
                    there anything in it which an animal could not possess? But when I distinguish the wax from its
                    outward forms—take the clothes off, as it were, and consider it naked—then although my judgement may
                    still contain errors, at least my perception now requires a human mind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But what am I to say about this mind, or about myself? (So far, remember, I am not admitting that
                    there is anything else in me except a mind.) What, I ask, is this “I” which seems to perceive the
                    wax so distinctly? Surely my awareness of my own self is not merely much truer and more certain than
                    my awareness of the wax, but also much more distinct and evident. For if I judge that the wax exists
                    from the fact that I see it, clearly this same fact entails much more evidently that I myself also
                    exist. It is possible that what I see is not really the wax; it is possible that I do not even have
                    eyes with which to see anything. But when I see, or think I see (I am not here distinguishing the
                    two), it is simply not possible that I who am now thinking am not something. By the same token, if I
                    judge that the wax exists from the fact that I touch it, the same result follows, namely, that I
                    exist. If I judge that it exists from the fact that I imagine it, or for any other reason, exactly
                    the same thing follows. And the result that I have grasped in the case of the wax may be applied to
                    everything else located outside me. Moreover, if my perception of the wax seemed more distinct after
                    it was established not just by sight or touch but by many other considerations, it must be admitted
                    that I now know myself even more distinctly. This is because every consideration whatsoever which
                    contributes to my perception of the wax, or of any other body, cannot but establish even more
                    effectively the nature of my own mind. But besides this, there is so much else in the mind itself
                    which can serve to make my knowledge of it more distinct, that it scarcely seems worth going through
                    the contributions made by considering bodily things.

                <p>
                    I see that without any effort I have now finally got back to where I wanted. I now know that even
                    bodies are not strictly perceived by the senses or the faculty of imagination but by the intellect
                    alone, and that this perception derives not from their being touched or seen but from their being
                    understood; and in view of this I know plainly that I can achieve an easier and more evident
                    perception of my own mind than of anything else. But since the habit of holding on to old opinions
                    cannot be set aside so quickly, I should like to stop here and meditate for some time on this new
                    knowledge I have gained, so as to fix it more deeply in my memory.
